### **Please note:**
I am often asked by companies who hire me to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements which restrict me from publishing code samples to my GitHub account. I do of course have MANY code samples beyond the contents of this public repository. Should you wish to see anything beyond what this repository contains (such as some of my more recent React code), please [get in touch with me](mailto:martin@martinburford.co.uk).

> # Overview

This repository includes a selection of code samples from some projects I've been involved in over the past 10 years or so. 

I've been a Front-End Developer for approximately 25 years. Technology has changed a huge amount in this time, and currently, the languages that underpin the market are going through a huge transformation. This is why I've only included a few code samples, and only from the past few years. I don't feel there is much value in providing code samples from 10+ years ago, as technology has changed, and my own coding style/efficiency has also changed enormously.

Within the samples provided in this repository, I've included what I see as a reasonable cross-section of the work I am often involved in. It is however only a small illustration of the type of work I have done. I've worked on over 150 websites in my career, ranging from white-label platforms, through to multi-lingual sites, arabic sites, right-to-left reading sites, device-only sites, responsive web development, single-page applications, real-time websocket sites. The list goes on and on!

> # Lead React Developer @ Freshfields

I led all aspects of the front-end development of a project which required an existing Sharepoint instance (consisting of over 1,500 sites) to be completely re-skinned. Microsoft try so incredibly hard to get you to not do this. So, this project required a very delicate touch, to make sure that what was bespoke built wouldn't interfere with the bits of Sharepoint that were important to the business and needed to remain ... and there were MANY! To do this, I built a comprehensive set of React components, using Sass and TypeScript, which were then published as a component library to a privately scoped NPM package. This was then imported into Sharepoint, and via SPFX, was used to create custom Sharepoint Webparts, which were then fed data from the Sharepoint graph. This ultimately led to having a largely headless Sharepoint instance to play with, which was absolutely what the client had asked for ... and they weren't actually sure if it could technically be done. The project was a huge success, as it allowed what had become an ageing (Sharepoint) intranet from the past few years to be given a new lease of life.

Whilst I was looking for work in late 2023, I decided to be productive alongside job-hunting, by re-writing my portfolio for the first time in 7 years. It's often the case that a Developers (particularly a Front-End Developers) website is never that representative of what they do for work. So I thought it was the perfect time to give things a refresh and a complete overhaul.

I led a team of 3x Front-End Developers, working on a greenfield HR platform that aims to provide the features of solutions such as Workday, in terms of Leave Requests, Payroll, Timesheets etc, but in a way whereby the control is put in the fingers of the users. The idea being that much of the need to depend on a HR team can therefore be removed, resulting in the increases to the speed and efficiency of the tasks needing to be done.

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/deals-plus-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
I worked as the sole Front-End Developer, working on a complete re-write of a platform, which focused on offering a dashboard-style set of screens showing complex datasets for investment portfolios for both individuals and companies. The nature of the data involved was often complex, as a result leaning on comprehensive use of AG Grid for tabular data, along with close to 100 bespoke written React components, utilising both Sass and TypeScript. Also of note within this project was the inclusion of react-hook-form, since there were around 50 forms, enabling authenticated users to add, edit and delete a whole host of data attached to their individual investments.

I was the sole Front-End Developer working on a UI component library, consisting of approximately 120 components, built from the ground up using React, TypeScript and Sass, in an Atomic Design pattern. I built a fully interactive headless eCommerce site, demonstrating all of the UI components via a NextJS app. I also built a comprehensive Storybook, helping to demonstrate all components rendered in a number of different ways, eg: different colour themes, different locales, left-to-right and right-to-left rendering. All components were fully responsive.

I was the sole Front-End Developer working on a Server-side rendered / re-hydrated React application built using React, Redux, TypeScript and Sass. The application provides the ability for companies to register and become part of a wider online community related to energy consumption, carbon emissions and ultimately, energy switching. The Front-End was built to work hand-in-hand with a custom built back-end, providing around 50 endpoints, catering for Authentication through to Registration, Signin in, Account playback etc. Extensive documentation of the project was built via a heavily customised Storybook, which I built from the ground up.

I was one of two Front-End Developers working on a Single Page Application build using both React and Redux. The application allowed for a website to be built and subsequently configured using a bespoke suite of components and templates. My involvement related to adjusting existing websites. This was achieved by accessing the configurable options of each component making up a websites page, getting both existing and setting new configuration values. On saving any configuration changes, the website was automatically updated, reflecting the changes made.

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/rehab-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
I spent close to a month at Rehab, helping out on a project which provided walkthroughs of a clients product that revolved around Crypto Currency. The deliverable was a single page React/Redux application which could be used primarily at trade shows. The application allows potential clients to see entire user journeys, and by entering real-world data, could use a mock instance of the platform to see how their organisation could benefit from the services offered by the product. One particularly nice feature I wrote in this project was an extremely comprehensive KeyReplacement component which allowed static keys in any part of the application (including large JSON files) to be replaced with dynamic values from a collection of Redux reducers. In addition to many other key types, this involved a number of specific Crypto algorithms embedded deep into the clients product suite.

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/lloyds-bank-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
My role at Lloyds was based on Strong Customer Authentication. Due to regulatory requirements, new methods need to be added to numerous banking platforms in order to support an increased level of security to the login process. I worked for 6 months in the role taking the WIP from a minimal MVP to a fully functional suite of components published across 2x separate private ECMA Script modules. There were many other areas to this project, including (but not limited to) the creation of a React component styleguide, a recursive screenshot generator via a headless browser, an Excel to JSON export utility and programmatically generated (interactive) SVG flows charts.

**May 2018 - October 2018**

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/biglight-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
Biglight hired me as the only Front-End Developer to work on an internal project for them, which would be used for managing test campaigns across all of their brands. Prior to the existence of this, the system in place was in need of updating as it involved data being kept in multiple spreadsheets, and was therefore not the easiest to work with. The new system was a completely greenfield project, whereby myself and a single back-end Developer worked on creating a new platform for the business which would replace in its entirety the existing system. It was also a requirement that clients would be granted access to the tests, so a set of rules were built into what was created to allow for both read and write priviliedges across a multi-tiered user hierarchy. From a tech stack perspective, Biglight are a Microsoft house, so there was a requirement to use .net Core for the back-end. The front-end that I wrote was very much written in a way whereby the project was responsive to a users input. This was achieved by implementing a RESTful API on the back-end with multiple touchpoints between the front and back-end. Upon delivery of the finished project, there were around 20 different endpoints, catering for all of the data transmission. This covered complete user management, a free-text search engine, an interactive dashboard, saving tests as PDF routine, the creation of complete tests and their subsequent editing along with MANY more features.

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/tangent-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
I was hired by Tangent to help with the second phase of a digital project rollout for one of their largest clients. Whilst phase 1 was largely completed by the time I started working, phase 2 was built using a completely different development platform, so was essentially a greenfield project. The relationship with this particular client was based on Tangent providing static front-end pages/assets to a remotely located back-end integration company, responsible for integrating that code into Sitecore. Despite this, the front-end tech stack worked on the basis of JSON data generating HTML pages via Pug templates, running on Node, using Express. In the 3 months I was at Tangent, I'd say approximately 125 or so new components were built (ES6 JavaScript, Pug templates, SASS), across around a dozen separate page templates. The timings were tight on the project, however the front-end and testing teams put in place were fantastic, and I think alot of people were surprised at just how quickly work was produced.

I spent a few months at Bond & Coyne, working on a website build for their largest client. The project I worked on was a single page (fully responsive) site and was built from scratch using a mixture of HTML, JavaScript and Sass. In the main, the site was built to compliment an offline brochure, however there were a few sections to the site which extended well beyond this. One such example was a data visualization feature, which was built to represent 2 different datasets with a total of a little over 175 million records. I had to write quite a few NodeJS scripts to manipulate the data into a viable format for web consumption. The creative demands on the project were extensive, leading to a number of unorthodox but fully compliant solutions that I had to build during the contract. This project was delivered on time, on budget, and the client, as well as Bond & Coyne were delighted with the end result.

<img src="https://www.martinburford.co.uk/assets/portfolio/listing-thumbnails/hsbc-1.png" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px" width="200" />
I was hired via Mansion House Consultingfor HSBC, to bring to life a conceptual project, in the form of a fully working prototype. The project was an XHR driven interface, integrated alongside a fully functional API, built to be responsive across a number of breakpoints. Once the prototype was completed and the concept was successfully proven to the relevant business units, it was handed over to an existing development team to drive the longer-term piece of work forward.

I was hired by Sapient to work on the front-end element of an internal Christmas project. The timeframes were extremely tight, and the hours were long. In working alongside a couple of very talented developers, and a supporting team of designers and UX staff, we managed to deliver something pretty amazing, taking into account the time we had available. The concept was to allow a user to submit URLs, which proved that 2016 wasn't all bad news, and that some of the things that happened over the course of the year were incredible and heart-warming. URLs provided were then scraped, tidied up a bit, and adapted into a more digestible format for the site we were building. The rendered output was a very rich interface, fully responsive, with animations primarily becoming active as elements of the page came into view. I built features such as advanced lazyloading, all custom animations, infinite page scrolling/loading, URL submission, Captcha validation, along with many more.

I returned to Trinity Mirror to work on a huge greenfield project (circa 60+ sites), helping with the overall architecture and development of the new digital platform for a company with monthly traffic levels in the tens of millions. The development teams technical stack comprised of full native JavaScript using Express on Node, alongside the templating language of Jade, which was used to translate the back-end data layer into both front-end components and pages. In addition, some of the other technologies used were Grunt, Karma, Mocha, Jade, Browserify, SASS. The list goes on. The project was spread across 10 teams of 10 individuals each, where 2 week sprints, inclusive of 2 releases per week were implemented in an Agile way.

I was originally hired by Trinity Mirror to bring to life several complex prototypes in order establish the feasibility of a number of new technologies, in respect of Trinity Mirrors existing content. After completing these prototypes, one such piece of work I built was so well received by the business that budget was allocated for the technologies I had written to be harnessed for a much larger football based project. Partnering with Opta, who perform statistical analysis on the Barclays Premier League, I wrote a real-time consumption framework of their data to allow Trinity Mirror to show live updates of the entire league during match days. After this work was completed, I extended the code to work for the 2014 football World Cup. The framework was coded to work on desktop browsers, tablets and mobile devices. In addition to this, a cross-section of other work I built during my time at Trinity Mirror included an entire JSON driven data visualization framework, canvas-based real-time heatmaps, particle fireworks, circular navigation systems, mobile friendly touch sensitive draggable voting plugins and a vast number of (websocket based) real-time JavaScript plugins, such as live football league tables, live graphs and live blog feeds.

I worked on 2 fairly similar projects during my 4 months at Profero. Both were extremely rich (in functionality) responsive front-end websites, built to work across desktop, mobile and tablet using a combination of HTML4/5, CSS 2/3 and JavaScript. The first site was designed and built as a full-screen immersive user experience, whereas the second was restricted and governed by a Sharepoint set of templates, running at fixed-width dimensions. Both were built 100% by me from scratch through to completion. The full-screen site required the building of a complete timelining JavaScript framework, allowing for a Flash-esque timeline and queuing mechanism, along with being dynamic in its ability to render in 1 of 4 different languages. The fixed-width site was more of a scroll site, albeit with gesture based alternatives for mobile and tablet switched in at appropriate times.

I worked at AKQA on a large project for one of their biggest clients, Nike, focusing on a complex mapping implementation. This involved latitudinal and longitudinal projections to enable dynamic tile loading via cached webservices. The main reason for this was because the mapping application was expected to receive around 100,000+ marker points, which quite obviously couldn't all be added to a single map instance at once. I wrote all the JavaScript through a number of custom Nike namespaces to allow a huge number of configurable variations of just how (and more importantly, when) different geolocational datasets were appended to the map.

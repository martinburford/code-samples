      The simple answer to this is yes, a library is used for <strong>ALL</strong> forms within the Aigence website. The
      library that's used is called{" "}

      . It's an extremely comprehensive and well written library, which in 2023 is the industry standard way of adding interactive
      forms into React projects

            So how is a simple form created using react-hook-form? Whilst offering more advanced functionality, for the
            sake of Aigence forms, React hook form works on the basis of 2x primary methods of form logic

          <Heading variant={5}>A basic overview of how React hook form works</Heading>
          <p>
            React hook form in its simplest form maintains the contents of an object, a simple key/value pair object,
            such as:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`{
  "field-1": "",
  "field-2": ""
  "field-3": ""
}`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            At all times, the contents of this object contains keys (which represent a unique form element) and values
            (which represent the value for that form element). If a key has a value, the form field has a value. If a
            key doesn't have a value, neither does the associated form field. It is the primary role of React hook form
            to maintain two-way binding between the form elements values (in a HTML / React form) and the data object it
            maintains (as above). So, in essence, when a form field value changes, its value is updated in real-time in
            the data object that React hook form is maintaining behind the scenes. Below is an example which visually
            demonstrates this (<strong>hint</strong>: type values into the fields):

      <StoryHeading heading="Registering a form element" />
      <p>
        In order to register a form element, there are a few techniques. The simplest of these is to use the{" "}
        <code>register</code> method, provided by React hook form. The example below uses the{" "}
        <code>&lt;Textfield&gt;</code> component, however the registration method is used in the same way regardless of
        the component that is being registered:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`<Textfield 
  {...register("field1")} 
  label="Field 1" 
  name="field1" 
  placeholder="Placeholder text" />
/>`}</CodeBlock>
      <br />
      What this does is creates an entry in the data object for a form instance, where the key in that object matches
      the name provided to the <code>register</code> method, in the case above, <code>form2-field1</code>.

          <p>
            So, how can a field be setup as a mandatory field where a form cannot submit unless a value is provided?
            Well, the logic is incredibly simple, however it's important to understand the difference between what React
            hook form is doing when you setup a field as required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that all React hook form is doing is maintaining a data object, which contains key / value pairs.
            When a field is configured to be required, React hook form is merely checking whenever a form is submitted
            to see whether the value for the key in its data object is empty or not. If it is empty, then the required
            field has not been populated.
          </p>
          <p>
            To setup a field as required, there is an additional (optional) configuration object which can be passed to
            the <code>register</code> method:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`{<Textfield 
  {...register("field1", { required: true })} 
  label="Field 1" 
  name="field1" 
  placeholder="Placeholder text" 
/>}`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            In this example, the simplest implementation of making a field required is to pass a prop of{" "}
            <code>required</code>, with a value of <code>true</code>, to the optional configuration object within{" "}
            <code>register</code>. In doing this, it will restrict the form from being submitted until a value is
            provided for the required field.
          </p>
          <p>Try submitting the below form with and without values entered in the form field:</p>
          <br />
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmitForm1(onSubmitFormDebug)}>
            <Fieldset heading="Form heading">
              <Textfield
                {...registerForm1("field1", { required: true })}
                label="Field 1"
                name="field1"
                placeholder="Placeholder text"
              />

                  "data-component-spacing": errorsForm1["field1"]?.type === "required" ? ESizes.M : "0",
                }}

              >
                Submit

                  ]}
                />
              )}
            </Fieldset>
          </form>
          <Heading variant={5}>So how does React hook form know that fields have no values?</Heading>
          <p>
            It's been previously mentioned that React hook forms primary purpose is to maintain (and persist) a data
            object, an object which has a live snapshot of a forms elements values at any given time. This is how form
            data is persisted. The way in which errors are persisted worked in an extremely similar way, and it's
            exposed via an <code>errors</code> object, consisting of identically named key/value pairs ... the names
            used when registering form elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is an interactive example of how errors are persisted. Try submitting the form with and without
            values. In this example <strong>ALL</strong> form fields have been initialized as requiring a value:
          </p>
          <br />
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmitForm2(onSubmitFormDebug)}>
            <Grid.Row>
              <Grid.Col mobile={{ span: 12 }} tabletPortrait={{ span: 6 }}>
                <Fieldset dataAttributes={{ "data-component-spacing": "0" }} heading="Form heading">
                  <Textfield
                    {...registerForm2("field1", { required: true })}
                    label="Field 1"
                    name="field1"
                    placeholder="Placeholder text"
                  />
                  <Textfield
                    {...registerForm2("field2", { required: true })}
                    label="Field 2"
                    name="field2"
                    placeholder="Placeholder text"
                  />
                  <Textfield
                    {...registerForm2("field3", { required: true })}
                    label="Field 3"
                    name="field3"
                    placeholder="Placeholder text"
                  />
                  <Button
                    compact={true}
                    dataAttributes={{ "data-component-spacing": "0" }}
                    isSubmit={true}
                    variant="primary"
                  >
                    Submit
                  </Button>
                </Fieldset>
              </Grid.Col>
              <Grid.Col mobile={{ span: 12 }} tabletPortrait={{ span: 6 }}>
                <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`${JSON.stringify(errorsObj, null, 4)}`}</CodeBlock>
              </Grid.Col>
            </Grid.Row>
          </form>
          <br />
          <p>
            The example above demonstrates how React hook form updates in real-time the contents of an{" "}
            <code>errors</code> object. This in term adds and removes object properties (to the <code>errors</code>{" "}
            object) as and when registered form fields meet (or don't meet ) their validation rules. In this particular
            case, the rules set are that the fields must be provided with a value. If they have a value, they are
            considered validated. If they don't have a value, a reference to that field is stored in the{" "}
            <code>errors</code> object, and the form is not submitted.
          </p>
          <Heading variant={5}>How can the errors object be accessed and used?</Heading>
          <p>
            When using React hook forms, there's a certain amount of scaffold code that is required. The code below is
            such an example that is required whenever a React hook form is used:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
            
const {
  handleSubmit,
  register,
} = useForm();`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            <code>useForm</code> is a hook, exported by React hook form, which provides several useful pieces of
            functionality. For example, <code>register</code> is the method used to register a form field, as described
            earlier. <code>handleSubmit</code> is the routine that should be executed on a form whenever it's submitted.
            For example:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`<form onSubmit={handleSubmitForm((data) => console.log(data))}>
  ...
</form>`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            To access the error object, this is also exposed via <code>useForm</code>:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`const {
  formState: { errors },
  handleSubmit,
  register,
} = useForm();`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            To show contextual error messages as part of a form field which is in an error state, the way that this is
            achieved within the Aigence code is to use the <code>hasError</code> prop of components.{" "}
            <strong>ALL</strong> of the following components have this prop:
          </p>
          <BulletList
            items={[
              { text: "Checkbox" },
              { text: "Datepicker" },
              { text: "Radio list" },
              { text: "Select" },
              { text: "SwitchToggle" },
              { text: "Textarea" },
              { text: "Textfield" },
            ]}
          />
          <p>... and in all of these components, the functionality works in an identical way.</p>

          <p>
            The last missing element to having live error messaging is to link up the live error object contents to each
            related component. In order to do this, the name that a field is registered as needs to be used in order to
            determine whether that specific field is valid OR erroring at a given time. Below is an example of how this
            is achieved:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`<Textfield 
  {...registerForm2("field1", { required: true })} 
  hasError={errors["field1"]?.type === "required"}
  label="Field 1" 
  name="field1" 
  placeholder="Placeholder text" 
/>`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            The above example queries the <code>errors</code> object that React hook form contains, looking for an entry
            that matches the registered name of the current form field. In the above example, this is{" "}
            <code>field1</code>. If there is an entry for this field within the <code>errors</code> object{" "}
            <strong>AND</strong> the error type is <code>required</code>, this means that the form field has not been
            filled in, and is therefore in an error state. This checked is passed into the{" "}
            <code>&lt;Textfield&gt;</code> components <code>hasError</code> prop, in a way whereby the check will return
            a boolean. If that boolean resolves as <code>true</code>, then the component is being informed that the
            error styling should be applied. Due to the way that React hook forms <code>error</code> object updates in
            real-time, so too will the visibility of the error state of components, provided they're written with the
            above logic.
          </p>
          <Heading variant={5}>Other validation rules</Heading>
          <p>
            There are a whole host of options that can be provided to the optional configuration object within the{" "}
            <code>register</code> method, such as minimum and maximum lengths, types (strings vs numbers), regex
            patterns, custom error messages etc. Further details on these can be found{" "}

          <p>
            Below is an example of how different error messages can be provided to form elements, based on different
            rules. For example, the textfield in the below form has 3x separate rules attached to it. Only when all of
            them are met will the fields be submittable:
          </p>
          <BulletList
            items={[{ text: "Required" }, { text: "Minimum of 2 characters" }, { text: "Maximum of 2 characters" }]}
          />

        React hook form offers support for controlled components, as opposed to uncontrolled components. In terms of the
        difference between these:
      </p>
      <Grid.Row>
        <Grid.Col mobile={{ span: 12 }} tabletPortrait={{ span: 6 }}>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`<Checkbox checked={true} />`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>Where the state of a component is controlled by a parent component, and is passed down via props</p>
        </Grid.Col>
        <Grid.Col mobile={{ span: 12 }} tabletPortrait={{ span: 6 }}>
          <CodeBlock language="jsx">{`<Checkbox />`}</CodeBlock>
          <br />
          <p>
            Where a component is allowed to operate its usual event handlers such as <code>onChange</code> independently
            from any provided state, and for its "live" value to be derived from that
          </p>
        </Grid.Col>
      </Grid.Row>
      <Divider />
      <p>
        So, in the case of using a <code>Controller</code>, it allows the data that React hook form persists for a field
        to be passed down to a controlled component. This means that two-way binding is established between the form and
        the form field. Typically, this feature would be used when working with third-party libraries such as Ant Design
        or Material UI, which typically offer controlled UI components.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is however another reason why you'd want to use React hook forms <code>Controller</code>. Whenever a form
        element is registered by React hook form (via <code>register</code>), it provides certain props to the form
        element. Props such as <code>onBlur</code>, <code>onChange</code> and <code>ref</code>. Whenever that form
        fields value changes, these internal props are used to persist the current state of the form field (managed
        internally by React hook form). If there is ever a scenario where a form element has to have a custom ref, or
        has to execute specific logic on <code>onBlur</code> or <code>onChange</code> that goes over and above handling
        the actual event itself, then a <code>Controller</code> will be required. An example of this may be that
        whenever a textfield has a value entered, a neighbouring component needs to be updated, telling the user whether
        the value they entered is a certain value. In this scenario, if you were to use <code>register</code>. as in the
        previous examples, an internal <code>onChange</code> handler would be executed by React hook form, leaving
        nowhere for logic to be placed to check the value entered and perform a subsequent UI update. To solve this
        problem, a <code>Controller</code> should be used. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="jsx">
        {`import { Controller, useForm } from "react-hook-form";
 
const {
  control,
  register
} = useForm();
 
<Controller
  control={control}
  name="textfield"
  render={({ field: { name, onBlur, onChange, value }, formState: { errors }}) => (
    <Textfield
      {...register(name, { required: true })}
      label="Textfield"
      name={name}
      onChange={(e) => {
        onChange(e);
 
        // Custom logic here
        // Check to see if value matches a specific value
      }}
      placeholder="Textfield"
    />
  )}
/>`}
      </CodeBlock>
      <br />
      <p>
        As can be seen in the above example, the <code>onChange</code> event handler is still executed, but because it
        executes the <code>onChange</code> returned by the <code>Controller</code>, it then allows additional
        functionality to be executed in parallel. You can also see in the code sample above that the <code>errors</code>{" "}
        data object for a controlled form element is also provided in the render props of the <code>Controller</code>,
        so that inline error logic is still possible for controled fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Were the regular <code>register</code> method to be used <strong>WITHOUT</strong> a <code>Controller</code> for
        this same example:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="jsx">
        {`import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
 
const {
  register
} = useForm();
 
<Textfield
  {...register(name, { required: true })}
  label="Textfield"
  name={name}
  onChange={(e) => {
    // Custom logic here
    // Check to see if value matches a specific value
  }}
  placeholder="Textfield"
/>`}
      </CodeBlock>
      <br />
      <p>What would happen is that:</p>
      <BulletList
        items={[
          {
            text: "Whenever the textfield value changes ... YES ... the custom logic WOULD be executed",
          },
          {
            text: "The form value would NOT persist within React hook forms state for that field, meaning it would be considered empty, regardless of a value having been provided",
          },
          {
            text: "The form fields value would NOT be provided as part of any form submission",
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Heading variant={4}>Why?</Heading>
      <p>
        In the above example, the <code>onChange</code> event that is executed on the textfield component overrides the{" "}
        <code>onChange</code> event that React hook form created by default via <code>register</code>. As a result,
        whenever the value changes in the component, its value isn't sent to React hook form. A <code>Controller</code>{" "}
        allows for the default event to be called in addition to other logic within the same handler, in this case{" "}
        <code>onChange</code>.
      </p>
      <Heading variant={4}>Another example</Heading>
      <p>
        The code sample below is from the Aigence-UI project whereby a <code>&lt;SwitchToggle&gt;</code> component has
        to update a boolean (held in component state). That booleans value determines whether a textfield on the same
        page is disabled or enabled. Because of the additional logic needing to be executed on the <code>onChange</code>{" "}
        handler of <code>&lt;SwitchToggle&gt;</code>, a <code>Controller</code> is required:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="jsx">
        {`import { Controller, useForm } from "react-hook-form";
 
// Hooks (state)        
const [chargeVisible, updateChargeVisible] = useState(false);
 
const {
  control,
  register
} = useForm();

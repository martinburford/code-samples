The new system was a completely greenfield project, whereby myself and a single back-end Developer worked on creating a new platform for the business which would replace in its entirety the existing system. It was also a requirement that clients would be granted access to the tests, so a set of rules were built into what was created to allow for both read and write privileges across a multi-tiered user hierarchy. From a tech stack perspective, Biglight are a Microsoft house, so there was a requirement to use .net Core for the back-end. The front-end that I wrote was very much written in a way whereby the project was responsive to a users input. This was achieved by implementing a RESTful API on the back-end with multiple touchpoints between the front and back-end. Upon delivery of the finished project, there were around 20 different endpoints, catering for all of the data transmission. This covered complete user management, a free-text search engine, an interactive dashboard, saving tests as PDF routine, the creation of complete tests and their subsequent editing along with MANY more features."

The relationship with this particular client was based on Tangent providing static front-end pages/assets to a remotely located back-end integration company, responsible for integrating that code into Sitecore. Despite this, the front-end tech stack worked on the basis of JSON data generating HTML pages via Pug templates, running on Node, using Express. In the 3 months I was at Tangent, I'd say approximately 125 or so new components were built (ES6 JavaScript, Pug templates, SASS), across around a dozen separate page templates. The timings were tight on the project, however the front-end and testing teams put in place were fantastic, and I think alot of people were surprised at just how quickly work was produced."

The project I worked on was a single page (fully responsive) site and was built from scratch using a mixture of HTML, JavaScript and Sass. In the main, the site was built to compliment an offline brochure, however there were a few sections to the site which extended well beyond this. One such example was a data visualization feature, which was built to represent 2 different datasets with a total of a little over 175 million records. I had to write quite a few NodeJS scripts to manipulate the data into a viable format for web consumption. The creative demands on the project were extensive, leading to a number of unorthodox but fully compliant solutions that I had to build during the contract. This project was delivered on time, on budget, and the client, as well as Bond & Coyne were delighted with the end result."

After this work was completed, I extended the code to work for the 2014 football World Cup. The framework was coded to work on desktop browsers, tablets and mobile devices. In addition to this, a cross-section of other work I built during my time at Trinity Mirror included an entire JSON driven data visualization framework, canvas-based real-time heatmaps, particle fireworks, circular navigation systems, mobile friendly touch sensitive draggable voting plugins and a vast number of (websocket based) real-time JavaScript plugins, such as live football league tables, live graphs and live blog feeds."

Due to the browser/device requirements, and a lack of browser support, I was unable to use CSS media queries. As a result, I opted to use the Adapt.js responsive framework. The website designs required both visual and functional differences between the different render modes (mobile and desktop), so I built an extensive framework to compliment Adapt, in order to activate and de-activate significant areas of site functionality when switching between device resolutions. This was coupled with 13 unique colour themes throughout the site, a combination of website section themes and corporate brand colours. These themes were made possible via a comprehensive use of CSS specificity. All JavaScript was built into a number of namespaces, built to work alongside jQuery, with functionality such as carousels built via bespoke jQuery plugins in order to deliver against the exact project requirements. Also whilst at VML, I was asked to implement a solution for another client, Premier League, whereby SVG graphing tracked the progress of teams throughout the football season. This was something that had been a pending piece of work for around 18 months at the time, and was something I was able to complete in just a single day, delighting their client."

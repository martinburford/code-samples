        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <section>
          <p>I started coding professionally in 1999, and have a deep passion for beautifully crafted web interfaces. My approach to work is always the same. I am driven by working with nice, smart people. I’m incredibly passionate about how the mechanics and visuals of a website work together in harmony, resulting in a stunning user experience. Yes, I code HTML, JavaScript, ES6, Node, SASS etc in every contract, but my true passion is in building the very best UI a website can have, with whatever technologies are required to do the job. Couple this with an obsessive side to my personality where I continually strive for the cleanest, most extendable and robust code possible. I work hard to ensure I only ever leave companies with code that I myself would be happy to inherit. If you wish to discuss potential contract roles with me, then <a href="mailto:martin@martinburford.co.uk">please do get in touch.</a></p>
          <p id="taking-time-out">I am currently taking some time out of work, to spend some time with my recently born son, along with taking the opportunity to spend some time looking at some web technologies I haven't had time to look at over the last year or so (eg: Babel, React, Redux, Webpack) and technologies I've used, but would like to know more about (eg: Browserify, ES6, Gulp, Node). Whilst I'm studying, I am also happy to look at the possibility of starting a new Front-End development contract position. So please get in touch if you have anything which you think may be of interest.</p>

          <p>Whilst the above are a consolidated list of my main strengths, I have of course been exposed to countless technologies, too many to mention on a CV. For example, I am familiar with GIT and SVN, I am happy to work on either Macs or PCs. I have coded PHP before, a little Java, some Python. I've done quite a bit of working with SVG and data visualization too, plus much more besides. In a contract, I do whatever I have to do, and use whichever technologies I have to use. If that involves learning something new, then that's just fine by me.</p>
